            Trash has been accumulating in our oceans
            for years in garbage patches. One of the largest
            and most well known one is the Great Pacific Garbage patch
            located bewtween Hawaii and california. To solve this issue we need
            to both stop the source of the trash and clean up what has already been
            polluting our oceans. The plastic trapped in these heaps will eventually
            break down into pieces smaller pieces making it increasingly difficult
            to clean up. The effects of these plasitcs could impact our ecosystems
            and health for years to come.
